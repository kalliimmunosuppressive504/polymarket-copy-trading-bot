# Polymarket Copy-Trading Bot

### *"CTRL+C, CTRL+TRADE"*

**Mirror a target trader's Polymarket activity from your own account** — TypeScript/Node, poll-based, with size caps and safety rails.

<br/>

*Portfolio, performance, and history — the kind of activity this bot watches and mirrors.*

## At a glance

| | |
|:--|:--|
| **Watch** | A target user (address or username → proxy) on Polymarket |
| **Poll** | On your schedule (`COPY_POLL_INTERVAL_MS`) |
| **Copy** | Similar orders from *your* wallet, with multiplier & max size limits |

If you've been looking for **polymarket bot**, **polymarket copy trading**, **polymarket trading bot typescript**, or **clob client bot** — you're in the right repo.

---

## See it in context

In the **Polymarket** app you'll see **Activity** (recent trades and claims) — the stream the bot polls — and **Positions** (how outcomes show up in your portfolio after execution), plus portfolio stats. The bot automates the *follow-the-leader* part so you don't have to chase every fill by hand.

---

## What it does

- **Watches** a target user (address or username → proxy) on Polymarket
- **Polls periodically** and fetches recent activity
- **Copies trades** to your account with optional risk controls (multiplier, max order size, trades-only mode)

---

## What it *doesn't* do

- **No profit guarantees**. If the target trader jumps off a cliff, the bot will politely ask if you'd like to join them.
- **Not a "magic arbitrage printer."** It's copy-trading. (If you want true arbitrage, you'll likely need additional routing, pricing, and latency work.)

## Clone and run (step by step)

### 1. Prerequisites

| Requirement | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| **Git** | So you can clone the repo ([install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) if needed). |
| **Node.js** | **v20 or newer** — check with `node -v`. Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) if required. |
| **npm** | Ships with Node; confirm with `npm -v`. |
| **Polymarket account** | Funded account you control. |
| **Secrets** | Your **EOA private key** and **Polymarket proxy / funder address** from the Polymarket UI (never share these). |

### 2. Clone the repository

Pick a parent folder on your machine, open a terminal there, then:

**HTTPS (works everywhere, no SSH setup):**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/flaviodesa/polymarket-copy-trading-bot
cd polymarket-copy-trading-bot
```

**SSH (if you use SSH keys with GitHub):**

You should see `package.json`, `src/`, and `.env.example` in the project root.

### 3. Install dependencies

From the project root (`polymarket-trading-bot/`):

```bash
npm install
```

This installs everything listed in `package.json` (including dev tooling used by `npm run dev`).

### 4. Create your environment file

The bot reads configuration from a **`.env`** file in the project root. Start from the template:

**Windows (Command Prompt or PowerShell):**

```bash
copy .env.example .env
```

**macOS / Linux:**

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

### 5. Edit `.env`

Open `.env` in your editor and set at least:

- **`COPY_TARGET_USER`** — Polymarket proxy address (`0x…`) or username of the trader to mirror.
- **`POLYMARKET_PRIVATE_KEY`** — your wallet private key (64 hex characters, with or without `0x`).
- **`POLYMARKET_ADDRESS`** — your **Polymarket proxy / funder address** from the Polymarket UI (not necessarily the same as your raw EOA address).

Optional variables (poll interval, size multiplier, caps, etc.) are documented in [Configuration](#configuration) and in `.env.example`.

**Security:** Never commit `.env` or paste keys into issues or chat. `.gitignore` should keep `.env` local; if you fork the repo, double-check before pushing.

### 6. Run the bot

**Development** (TypeScript with watch / typical local workflow):

```bash
npm run dev
```

**Production-style** (compiles TypeScript with `npm run build`, then runs `node dist/index.js`):

```bash
npm start
```

Leave the terminal open while the bot runs. Stop with **Ctrl+C**.

### 7. Quick sanity checks

- If the process exits immediately, read the error: missing `POLYMARKET_PRIVATE_KEY`, bad hex, or unresolved `COPY_TARGET_USER` are common fixes (see **Troubleshooting** below).
- For first tests, use a **small** `COPY_SIZE_MULTIPLIER` and a **non-zero** `COPY_MAX_ORDER_USD` cap (see **Safety** below).

## Quick reference

| Step | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Clone the repo |  |
| Enter folder | `cd polymarket-copy-trading-bot` |
| Install | `npm install` |
| Env file | `copy .env.example .env` (Windows) or `cp .env.example .env` (macOS/Linux) |
| Run (dev) | `npm run dev` |
| Run (start) | `npm start` |

---

## Configuration

All config is via environment variables (see `.env.example`).

### Copy target

Pick one:

- **`COPY_TARGET_USER`**: target proxy address *or* username (the bot will try to resolve username → proxy)

### Core knobs

| Variable | What it controls | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `COPY_POLL_INTERVAL_MS` | How often to poll for new activity | `15000` |
| `COPY_ACTIVITY_LIMIT` | How many recent activities to consider per poll | `100` |
| `COPY_SIZE_MULTIPLIER` | Multiply copied trade size | `1` |
| `COPY_MAX_ORDER_USD` | Hard cap per copied order (0 = no cap) | `25` |
| `COPY_TRADES_ONLY` | If `true`, avoids copying non-trade activity | `true` |

### Your wallet / Polymarket account

| Variable | Required | Notes |
|---|---:|---|
| `POLYMARKET_PRIVATE_KEY` | ✅ | 64 hex chars (with or without `0x`) |
| `POLYMARKET_ADDRESS` | ✅ | Your Polymarket proxy/funder address (from UI) |
| `POLYMARKET_SIGNATURE_TYPE` | ❌ | Usually auto-detected; override only if needed |
| `POLYMARKET_CHAIN_ID` | ❌ | Defaults to Polygon in most setups |

---

## Safety / "please don't DM me at 3AM"

- **Never commit your `.env`**. If you do, the internet will treat it like free samples at Costco.
- Consider running on a **fresh wallet** with limited funds while testing.
- Start with `COPY_SIZE_MULTIPLIER=0.1` and a small `COPY_MAX_ORDER_USD`.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **`POLYMARKET_PRIVATE_KEY is required...`**  
  Your key is missing or not valid hex. The bot accepts **64 hex chars** with optional `0x`.

- **"Could not resolve username to proxy"**  
  Use a **proxy address** (0x…) for `COPY_TARGET_USER` or set the correct target.

## FAQ

### Is this "arbitrage"?

It can be part of an arbitrage workflow, but by itself it's primarily **copy trading**. If you're building true arbitrage, you'll probably add market scanning, price diff logic, and execution routing.

### Is it fast?

It's **poll-based** (`COPY_POLL_INTERVAL_MS`). If you need low-latency mirroring, you'll want a streaming approach.
